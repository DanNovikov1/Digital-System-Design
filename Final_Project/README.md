##Crazy Pong
This is a modification of the Pong program.
The bat is changed into a triangle, however, the hit detection is the same as that of a square with the same height.
Up to 50 balls are supposed to be supported at once, however, this is buggy and seemingly only one ball is displayed at any given time.
