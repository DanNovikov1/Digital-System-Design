# Digital System Design - CPE 487
## Course Objective
To learn to use the hardware description language, VHDL, to develop technical documentation for complex digital systems.
##Assignment 1
The first assignment was to find a new example of VHDL code. I found an example of an Odd Parity Generator.

##Assignment 2
The second assignment was to run a test bench for an example of VHDL code. I used the second example from the document of assignment 1.
The benchmark for the Odd Parity Generator did not compile due to the use of some non-standard library.
I used the Pulse Generator instead, GTKWave screenshot included
